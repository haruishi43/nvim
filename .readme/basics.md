# Basics of NeoVim

Tabs and splits aren't the same as in other [editors](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/discussions/932).

## Tabs

My keybindings:
- <l>to: open a new tab
- <l>tx: close the tab
- <l>tn and tp: next and previous tab

- `cib`: change in bracket
- `ciw`: change in word
- `vib`: highlight in bracket
