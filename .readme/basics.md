# Basics of NeoVim

## Normal Mode:
- `%` can jump between matching brackets. Can be combined with other actions like `d` or `c` to delete or change the content inside the brackets.


## Visual Mode:
- `o` can switch the location of the cursor in visual mode.

Tabs and splits aren't the same as in other [editors](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/discussions/932).

## Tabs

My keybindings:
- <l>to: open a new tab
- <l>tx: close the tab
- <l>tn and tp: next and previous tab

- `cib`: change in bracket
- `ciw`: change in word
- `vib`: highlight in bracket

## Registers

- when searching with yanked text, `<C-R>` is useful to reuse previous registers
